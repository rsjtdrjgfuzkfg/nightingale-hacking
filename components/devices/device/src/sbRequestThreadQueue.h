/**
 * This class implements a mechanism to allow processing of requests off the
 * main thread. PushRequest places requests on the queue. BatchBegin and
 * BatchEnd mark the start and end of batches. Batches of requests are processed
 * via the pure virtual method ProcessBatch. Derived classes implement this to
 * do work specific to their needs. Start is called to start the request thread
 * and Stop is used to stop the request thread.
 *
 * sbRequestItem is owned by sbRequestThreadQueue when pushed onto the queue.
 * A reference is added. When PopBatch is called, ownership is transferred to
 * the Batch object passed in. The sbRequestItem object holds a reference and
 * releases it when the Batch is destroyed or the item is erased via erase or
 * clear methods. Batch's destructor calls clear.
